**Orange Region - Operator Groups**

* Graphing has following overflow operator groups
  * Trig (same as Scientific)
  * Inequalities (=, <, <=, >, >=)
  * Functions (floor, ceil, and abs)
* See overflow panel slide for more details

**Red Region - Variables**
* X and Y are special variables exposed top-level

**Green Region - Equals and Submit**
* In graphing mode, the equals button means something else, so the “submit” button is replaced with a submit/enter button to plot the equation in bottom-right corner
* The “=“ button is exposed top-level (also included in variables operator overflow group)

**Black Region - Mode-specific**
* Space not used by common keyboard components are reserved for mode-specific buttons
* Like operators are grouped together, when possible
