# Calculator Diagnostic Data Spec

## Goals
To make decisions about what user experiences to focus on, we need to understand which parts of calculator are used most often and whether they're working correctly. We want to update the app-specific diagnostic information Calculator is collecting to answer questions like these:

  1. Is Calculator app meeting its performance metrics?
  2. Which Calculator mode is the best default experience?
  3. Can users discover all the calculators and converters in the app?
  4. What changes can we make to the keyboard layout to optimize for the most used operators?
  5. Are History and memory features used by the users?
  6. Does Calculator need to support multi-instance? 
  7. Where is the product non-fatally failing (error/exception)?

## Proposal
Removing legacy diagnostics that we do not anticipate needing for upcoming planning. Update the diagnostic events being logged. Create new clean diagnostic schema to support the goals.

## Feature Details
### Event Logging
_Note: As mentioned in Microsoft’s Privacy Statement https://privacy.microsoft.com/en-US/privacystatement#maindiagnosticsmodule, sampling is involved in Microsoft’s diagnostic data collection process.  The keywords that are associated to event definitions provide additional input into how frequently an event might be sampled. Lower level events may be sampled more frequently than higher level events._
